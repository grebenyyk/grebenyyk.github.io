<p>About two months ago I went to Shanghai for a weekend to run the first race of my life, the half marathon. The official time of 1:35:09 made me happy; and I didn&rsquo;t quite expect to be that fast.</p>
<p>Pudong airport is massive. I had a taste of that last summer while making a layover, but not to that extent. I think it was the first time the trip from the gate to terminal exit was so long that I got annoyed to the point of not having fun during that usually short arrival ritual. I make a mean face to peacefully pass two young gentlemen targeting foreigners to lure them into an overpriced taxi ride to the city. The mean face is supposed to signal that I&rsquo;m not here for the first time. I am, in fact, and maybe the gentlemen know. I hop on an official taxi. It is some 20-year-old Volkswagen reminding me of cars in my Siberian hometown. I give the driver the address of a local market on the island, where I need to pick up my race kit. The driver warns about a &ldquo;big bridge&rdquo; ahead and the road fee that comes with it. Even before the trip, I was at peace with the idea that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t make it to the city center this time to see the famous Shanghai skyline on the Huangpu river. The price of the trip across the big bridge and a giant traffic jam as long as the bridge itself just solidified the suspicion.</p>
<p>I love that name, Huangpu. It sounds both majestic and accommodating with the warmth of street food at a morning hawkers market. I&rsquo;ve never seen the markets of Shanghai specifically, but they aren&rsquo;t that different all across China.</p>
<p>We cross the big bridge and enter Chongming Island, the big one in the Yangtze delta. This is the second time I cross the Yangtze. The first one was last summer in Sichuan when traveling from Shenzhen to Chengdu by high-speed rail. On the same trip I would go further north to Lanzhou and see Huanghe and its unforgettable color. There is also an old bridge across Huanghe in Lanzhou. Not a big one, but still.</p>
<p>Big rivers fascinate me. I think it has something to do with my Siberian hometown on the shores of the Ob, which is massive and powerful. It is the closest instance you have of a sheer force of nature there. There is no sea, no mountains, no jungle that could absorb every artificial structure if you give it some time, but there is the Ob. When I was a kid, I read books about Don and how people can see each other from the opposite shores. I was baffled. I was thinking, is this Don really as important as the books tell?</p>
<p>Already deep into the race, I cross the bridge. The plaque on it states in Chinese 无名桥, no-name bridge. That is where the trip begins and ends, on a bridge across the river. Everything comes down to this unnamed bridge and me, a young man running across it. My aspirations from 10 years ago for travel, for writing and reading, my running pursuits now, all of these have no name except the ones I can give them. I carry all of them over the unnamed bridge across the unnamed river. It&rsquo;s up to me whether I make it to and over the big one. But for now, crossing this unnamed bridge was enough.</p>
